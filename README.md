# LIVE-WALLPAPER


There are already so many live wallpaper changers that exist (Either using gif or some other wayaround) SO WHY DOES THIS EXIST??
1. Most of them are application based which keep on running in the background and I have a bad habit of closing every application running in background...
SO this application's goal is to just set the wallpaper to a gif(as windows doesnt allow it by default)
2. .....///



Some repos close to what i was doing:

1. https://github.com/astr0n8t/battery-wallpaper-windows/blob/master/BatWall.cpp {main inspiration}
2. https://github.com/mcnameej/WallpaperChanger (didnt test it yet)
3. https://github.com/SegoCode/AutoWall (its in golang .. working as i want even though gui part is optional but not on restart i need to make it fix automatically on every restart)
4. https://github.com/wvovaw/gif-wallpaper (didnt test it yet - need to check once)
